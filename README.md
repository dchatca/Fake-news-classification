# Fake news classification with LSTM (Long Short-term memory) model 

About this project, this project is a hands-on project which I had found on Coursera. I think this hands-on project is very reasonable project for those who already have a little knowledge of `Neutral Network` and want to learn deeper about `Recurrent Neural Networks`, `Long Short-Term Memories`. This project will give you an overview of the basic steps to build a DL model in general and a NLP model in particular; from basic steps such as: `import library`, `load dataset`, `EDA`, `data cleaning`, `build and train model`, `access performance` to specific steps of a NLP project like `plot word-cloud`, `removing punctuation and stop words`, `tokenizing and padding on text corpus`. 


Me, after completed some DL courses on Coursera, I want to dig deeper more about NN, especially RNN and LSTM so that I choose this course. This course helps me consolidate my knowledge and gain new knowledge about natural language processing; understand the intuition behind RNN, LSTMs, how to prepare data by performing tokenization and padding.
